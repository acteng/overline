# overline

Overline is a function that takes overlapping linestrings and converts them into a route network [@morgan2020] as illustrated in a minimal reproducible example below.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(stplanr)
sl = routes_fast_sf[2:3, 0]
sl$n = 1:2
plot(sl)
rnet = overline(sl, attrib = "n")
plot(rnet)
sf::write_sf(sl, "minimal-example-input.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
sf::write_sf(rnet, "minimal-example-output.geojson", delete_dsn = TRUE)
```

The function has been implemented in the [`overline()` function](https://docs.ropensci.org/stplanr/reference/overline.html) in the R package `stplanr`. The function works fine for city sized datasets but for national datasets is slow, buggy and not feature complete, as it does not retain OSM IDs. This repo provides a place to discuss and develop example code to solve this problem.

In Python, the input and outputs can be visualised as follows:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
input = gpd.read_file("input.geojson")
input.plot()
```

```{python}
output = gpd.read_file("output.geojson")
output.plot()
```
