# overline

Overline is a function that takes overlapping linestrings and converts them into a route network, as illustrated in a minimal example below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(stplanr)
sl = routes_fast_sf[2:3, 0]
sl$n = 1:2
plot(sl)
rnet = overline(sl, attrib = "n")
plot(rnet)
sf::write_sf(sl, "minimal-example-input.geojson")
sf::write_sf(rnet, "minimal-example-output.geojson")
```


The function has been implemented in the R package `stplanr` but is slow, buggy and not feature complete.
This repo provides a place to discuss and develop example code to solve this problem.

In Python, the input and outputs can be visualised as follows:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
input = gpd.read_file("input.geojson")
input.plot()
```
